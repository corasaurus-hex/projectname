# projectname

An example go project to show how you might structure a go project.

Includes a build script to make things easy. See the comments at the top of build.sh for more info.

Check out the contents of the src directory to see how to start an application and how to build application-specific custom packages.

Any packages that you'd like to share between projects shouldn't be in your project. You should store them somewhere else on your $GOPATH.
